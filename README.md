# video-rental-suite

## Overview

This is a desktop application with local database connections and online capabilities that will provide a fictional video store rental team the ability to create video rental records when customers of their store rent (or buy) videos and/or video games.

This will include tracking the time elapsed between when a video is rented by a specific customer and when they return it, with optional penalties being applied to those who return their videos late or not at all.
